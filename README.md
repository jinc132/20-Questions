# 20-Questions
An QuestionsGame is a guessing game in which it asks multiple yes or no questions to determine the final answer. It will play the game once. If the computer determines the answer correctly then, it wins. Otherwise, if it does not then the client wins. The client has the ability to create a new QuestionsGame from scratch or modify to make it better.
